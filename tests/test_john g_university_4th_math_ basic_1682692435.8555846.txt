Question:1

If a university student studied for 6 hours and read 8 books, how many hours did the student spend reading? 
Question answer:

8 hours 

 Students answer:1 and a half 
About Your Question :

Your answer is incorrect. 1.5 and 8 hours are not comparable as they are measured in two different units; 1.5 is measured in units of a fraction of an hour, whereas 8 hours is measured in units of a full hour.

Question answer: they wrote 84 pages in total. 

 Students answer:13  
About Your Question :

Your answer is incorrect. The comparison of 13 and 84 has nothing to do with how many pages they wrote in total. 
------------------------------------------------------ 

Question:3

If the sum of two congruent angles is 180°, what is the measure of each angle? 
Question answer:

Each angle is 90°.

About Your Question :.

Your answer is correct. 90° is the same no matter which angle is being referred to.

Question:4

The university student must calculate how many minutes are in 53.2 hours? 
Question answer:

3,192 minutes.

------------------------------------------------------ 

Question:5

If a university student spends 5 hours studying for a math exam, and she studies for 3 hours more each day for the next three days, how many hours will she have studied in total for the exam when she is done? 
Question answer: the total hours she has studied for the exam is 18 hours. 

 Students answer:37 
About Your Question :

Your answer is incorrect, as 37 is not a number of hours, so it cannot be compared with the total number of hours she has studied for an exam.
